## Quality of Life Features (Considerations for initial or later implementation)

-   **Model Information:** Display basic information about models (size, type e.g., '.en' for English-only) when listing. Use regular expressions to match basic patterns of the model filename to deduce this information.
-   **Default Model:** Consider allowing the user to set a default model to be pre-selected or automatically used if only one is present.
-   **Checksum Verification:** Integrate checksum verification for downloaded models to ensure integrity.
-   **Background Downloads:** For larger models, consider if background downloading with progress indication is necessary (might be overly complex for a console app initially).

This plan will be refined as development progresses. Detailed implementation steps for each task will be broken down further.
